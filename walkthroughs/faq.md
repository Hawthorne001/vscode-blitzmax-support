## FAQ & Troubleshooting

* What languages are supported?
	* Only [BlitzMax NG](https://blitzmax.org/) is officially supported.\
	You can enable the *'Legacy Mode'* build option for basic BlitzMax Vanilla/Legacy build support.\
	_(I highly recommend you upgrade to [BlitzMax NG](https://blitzmax.org/))_

* Why is the [outlines](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_outline-view) view and [breadcrumbs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_breadcrumbs) not working?
	* These features are provided by the [LSP](#note-about-using-the-language-server-protocol) server.\
	Make sure your current [LSP](#note-about-using-the-language-server-protocol) supports these features.

* I've found an issue / I'd like to make a feature request\, what do I do?
	* Is the issue or request already listed at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Hezkore/vscode-blitzmax-support/issues)?\
	If not, you can open up a new [GitHub issue here](https://github.com/Hezkore/vscode-blitzmax-support/issues/new).

* How do I _`<do this or that>`_ in VS Code?\
	_(aka. I need more help)_
	* For general questions or VS Code related help you have few options:
