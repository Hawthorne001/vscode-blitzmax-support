You can also select the specific text you want formatted.

VS Code has many optional settings for automatic formatting, including "Format On Type" and "Format On Save".

The code formatter needs to be installed manually and the "formatter path" needs be set in your [BlitzMax extension settings](command:blitzmax.settings).\
