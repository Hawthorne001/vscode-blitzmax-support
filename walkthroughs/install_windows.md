# Installing BlitzMax NG

While this extension supports original BlitzMax _(known as Vanilla, or Legacy)_ using the "Legacy" build option _(more info in the "Building & Tasks" step)_, it is highly recommended that you use BlitzMax NG instead.\
BlitzMax NG is available for Windows x32/x64, Linux and MacOS, and compiles to many other platforms.

You can always find the latest version at [blitzmax.org](command:blitzmax.homepage)

_Make sure to read the Windows specific instructions for installing BlitzMax NG\
