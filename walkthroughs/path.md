## Selecting your BlitzMax path

The VS Code BlitzMax extension needs to know where you've installed BlitzMax.\
Press the "Select Path" button or click [here](command:blitzmax.pickBlitzMaxPath) to select your BlitzMax path.\
Remember to select the root folder, not the "bin" folder.

You can always change the path later in your [BlitzMax extension settings](command:blitzmax.settings).
